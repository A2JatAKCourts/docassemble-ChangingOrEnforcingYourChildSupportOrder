content: |
  <p>A child support order from Alaska Child Support Services Division (CSSD) is called an administrative order.  CSSD can change administrative orders.  This is called "modifying" child support.</p>
  <p>CSSD can modify your order if: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The cost of your child's health insurance premium changes, or </li>
    <li>Your income or the other parent's income changes so that a new child support calculation would be at least 15% more or 15% less than the payment you have now, or </li>
    <li>Your children's schedule changes so that a new child support calculation would be at least 15% more or 15% less than the payment you have now. </li>

   <li>If your parenting schedule changes, or your income or the other parent's income changes, it is important to tell CSSD <strong>right away</strong>. </li>
    <li>CSSD cannot go back and change child support that was due in the past. </li>
    <li>Until you contact CSSD, the old child support amount applies and the parent who owes child support still owes the old amount, even if income or the schedule has changed. </li>

  Step ${ learn_reconsider_idx }: Learn about Motions to Reconsider
content: |
  <p>To ask your trial judge to reconsider a  decision, file a <strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong></p>
  <p>You have only 10 days after the date the  court sent your child support order to you. </p>
  <p>Look at the last page of the order. The date  to count from is in the box at the bottom of the page. The box looks something  like this.</p>
  
  [FILE CertOfDistrAnnotated.png, 100%, This is a screenshot of the box that shows the date the court sent your order to you.]
  
  <p> If the 10th day is a  weekend or holiday, your motion is due the next day the court is open.  For example, if the 10th day is a Saturday,  and the court is open Monday, your motion is due Monday.  If Monday is a holiday, your motion is due  Tuesday.</p>
  <div class='step-subheading'>You can ask a judge to reconsider  their decision for 4 reasons </div>
  <ol>
    <li>The judge overlooked, misapplied or failed to  consider a statute, decision or principle directly controlling. This means the  judge made a mistake when they applied the law in your case.
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rule 90.3 states that if a child spends at least  256 nights with one parent, that parent has primary custody and the other  parent  pays 20% of their adjusted annual  income for child support to the parent the child lives with. .</li>
        <li>If the judge used 27% of adjusted income instead  of 20%, the <strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong> would state that the judge misapplied Civil Rule 90.3.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The judge overlooked or misconceived some  material fact or proposition of law. This means the judge got an important fact  wrong.
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The parents agree that mom makes $25,000 every  year. They file the forms to tell the judge they agree. The judge calculated  child support using $35,000 for mom's income. </li>
        <li>The <strong>Motion  to Reconsider</strong> would state that the judge used the wrong income to calculate  child support.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The judge overlooked or misconceived a material  question in the case. This means the judge misunderstood what you were asking for.
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A child changed from living full time with their  mom to living full time with their dad. Under the child support formula, dad  used to pay child support to mom based on the primary custody child support  calculation. Now, mom should pay child support to dad based on the primary  custody child support calculation. Dad filed a motion to modify child support.  The judge denied dad's motion because the parents' incomes did not change.  </li>
        <li>The <strong>Motion  to Reconsider</strong> would state the judge did not include the changed parenting  schedule in the child support calculation.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The law applied in the ruling was changed by a later  court decision or statute. This means the judge used a rule or law that  changed.
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>On April 15, 2018, Civil Rule 90.3 changed to  allow a parent to deduct the cost of their own health insurance from their  gross income, up to 10% of the parent's gross income.</li>
        <li>If the judge calculated child support on April  14 and did not subtract the cost of the parent's health insurance, the Motion  to Reconsider would explain the cost of the parent's health insurance and state  that Civil Rule 90.3 changed on April 15, 2018.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>See <a href="https://courts.alaska.gov/rules/docs/civ.pdf">Alaska Rule of Civil Procedure</a> 77(k) to read the court rules about the <strong>4 reasons</strong> you can ask the court to reconsider a judge's decision:</p>

subject: |
  Step ${ learn_modify_idx }: Learn about Motions to Modify
content: |
  Changing your child support order is called “modifying” child support.  The child support rule, [Alaska Rule of Civil Procedure 90.3](https://courts.alaska.gov/rules/docs/civ.pdf), states you need to prove there has been a “material change in circumstances” to modify child support. The most common changes in circumstances are:
  
    * Your children's schedule changes and they spend more or fewer overnights with you than they used to, or
    * Your income or the other parent's income changes.
    
  <div class='step-subheading'>Calculate your new child support amount</div>
  Figure out the new child support amount using the new schedule or new income information.  
    
    * Calculate the percent of overnights your children spend with you and with the other parent. For example, if your child spends 4 nights each week with you and 3 nights each week with their other parent, they spend 209 overnights each year with you and 156 nights each year with the other parent.  This is 57% of overnights with you and 43% of overnights with the other parent.  
    * Use the percentages to fill out the <strong>Child Support Guidelines Affidavit</strong>, [<a href="https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-305.pdf">DR-305</a>]. Read [How to Fill out the Child Support Guidelines Affidavit](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-dr305f-sample.pdf) to help you fill out this form.
    * If your children have a primary custody child support schedule, the <strong>Child Support Guidelines Affidavit</strong> tells you the new child support amount. If you do not have a primary custody child support schedule, use one of these forms:
    <ul>
  <li><strong>Shared Custody Support Calculation, [DR-306]</strong> [<a href="https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-306.pdf">Fill-In PDF</a>] for a shared custody schedule, </li>
  <li><strong>Hybrid Custody Child Support Calculation, [DR-308]</strong> [<a href="https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-308.pdf">PDF</a>] for a hybrid custody child support schedule, or</li>
  <li><strong>Divided Custody Child Support Calculation, [DR-307]</strong> [<a href="https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-307.pdf">PDF</a>] for a divided custody child support schedule.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class='step-subheading'>Compare the old and new child support amounts to see if there is a material change in circumstances.</div>
    * If the new child support amount is 15% more or less than the old amount, there is a presumption that there is a material change in circumstances.
    * For example, if the old child support amount was $100 per month, there would be a material change if the new amount was
    * $85 or less, or
    * $115 or more.
  <div class='step-subheading'>Timing</div>
  
    * If your parenting schedule changes, or your income or the other parent’s income changes, it is important to tell the court **right away**.
    * The judge cannot go back and change child support that was due in the past.  They can only change child support starting when you file something asking to change it, and notify the other parent that you are asking for a change.
    * Until you file a motion in court, the old child support amount applies and the parent who owes child support still owes the old amount, even if income or the schedule has changed.
    * After you file your motion, but before the judge decides, can be confusing.  If the judge changes child support, they also pick the day the new amount starts.  This is usually the day a parent filed a Motion to Modify and gave it to the other parent.
  If child support changes, 1 parent may owe the other money for the time between when the motion was filed and when the judge decided.

    * Use the Guided Assistant Interview [Changing Your Custody or Parenting Plan Order](https://docassemble.akcourts.gov/start/ChangingChildCustody) for a Personal Action Plan about changing both child support and your schedule.

  <p>Only the judge can change the amount of child support in your  order.</p>
  <p>But you can use a <strong>Joint  Motion to Modify Child Support</strong> to tell the judge about your agreement if you both agree that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>your financial situation has changed,</li>
    <li>the amounts you use to calculate child support  have changed, <strong>and</strong></li>
    <li>after you use the child support formula, you get  a different amount from the amount in your current order. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>If both parents agree the amount should change, file your joint  motion <strong>right away</strong>. Until you file  your motion with the court, <strong>the parent  who owes child support still owes the amount in your current order</strong>.</p>
  <p>If the judge agrees to change the amount of your child support,  the judge will sign a new order. The new order includes the date the amount  changed. This date is usually in the past. It will not be earlier than the date  you filed your motion.</p>
  <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>You agree about a new child support amount on  March 1, but you do not file anything with the court until June 21.</li>
    <li>The judge agrees to change your child support  and signs a new child support order on September 1.</li>

        <li>An unexpected action, sudden confusion or an  unanticipated event - surprise, or </li>
        <li>A legitimate excuse for failing to take required  action - excusable neglect.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <p>You ask the judge to set aside the decision  made at a hearing you missed because: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You had a heart attack the day before, and </li>
        <li>You were in the ICU, so you could not attend.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Newly  discovered evidence which could not have been discovered by taking reasonable  steps within the 10 days allowed to request a new trial.
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>You gave your spouse $1,000 before the trial to pay the property  taxes on your marital home, and</li>
        <li>1 month after trial you learn your spouse did not pay the taxes.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Fraud,  misrepresentation, or other misconduct from the other side.
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <p>One spouse forges an appraisal of the marital home and uses it as  evidence at the divorce trial to argue the value of the house.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>For  the next 3 types of mistake, the amount of time before you file must be  &quot;reasonable."</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The judgment is  void.
      <p><strong>For example</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>An Alaska court generally does not have the authority or  &quot;jurisdiction&quot; to make a parenting  plan for a child who has lived in another state for the past 6 or more  months.  </li>
        <li>If a child was living in Oregon for 6 months before the divorce  case started, and</li>
        <li>A parent hid this detail from the other parent and the court, </li>
        <li>The parenting plan order would be void because the court did not  have jurisdiction to decide the parenting plan.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The judgment has been satisfied, released or  discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or  otherwise vacated or it is no longer fair that the judgment should apply at  this time.
      <p><strong>For  example</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The court orders a parent to pay child support. The child files  for Emancipation and the judge grants it. Parents do not have to support their  emancipated child. The child support judgment   would be released or discharged.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Any  other reason justifying relief from the judgment.
      <ul>
        <li> You may be able to come up with a different good reason the judge should  start the case over again. But your reason cannot be any of the 6 listed above – it must be  something different.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  Step ${ talk_w_other_parent_idx }: Talk to the other parent
content: |
  When the other parent is not following your child support order, you can ask the court to order them to follow it. It is a good idea to talk to the other parent first:
  
    * Ask the other parent in writing to do what the order says.
    * In your written request, give them a date to do it by.
    * Keep your writing polite and professional.  Remember the judge may see it.
    * Tell them if they do not do it you will ask the judge to enforce the order.
    * Keep a copy of your written request and any written response you get back.
    * Hopefully they will follow the order and you will not need to go back to court.
    * If the other parent still does not cooperate, let the court know by filing a motion. A motion is a form you file with the court asking the judge to order the other side to do something.
    * If you file a motion, attach a copy of what you wrote to the other parent and anything they responded.
