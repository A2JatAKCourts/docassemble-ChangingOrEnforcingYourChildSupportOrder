content: |
  <p>A child support order from Alaska Child Support Services Division (CSSD) is called an administrative order.  CSSD can change administrative orders.  This is called "modifying" child support.</p>
  <p>CSSD can modify your order if: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The cost of your child's health insurance premium changes, or </li>
    <li>Your income or the other parent's income changes so that a new child support calculation would be at least 15% more or 15% less than the payment you have now, or </li>
    <li>Your children's schedule changes so that a new child support calculation would be at least 15% more or 15% less than the payment you have now. </li>

    <li>CSSD cannot go back and change child support that was due in the past. </li>
    <li>Until you contact CSSD, the old child support amount applies and the parent who owes child support still owes the old amount, even if income or the schedule has changed. </li>

  Step ${ learn_reconsider_idx }: Learn about Motions to Reconsider
content: |
  To ask your trial judge to reconsider a decision, file a <strong>Motion to Reconsider</strong>.  You have only 10 days after the date the court sent your child support order to you. Look at the last page of the order. The date is in the box at the bottom of the page. 
    
  [FILE CertOfDistrAnnotated.png, None, This is a screenshot of the box that shows the date the court sent your order to you.]    
  
  [Alaska Rule of Civil Procedure](https://courts.alaska.gov/rules/docs/civ.pdf) 77(k) lists **4 reasons** you can ask the court to reconsider a judge's decision:
  <ol>
  <li>The court has overlooked, misapplied or failed to consider a statute, decision or principle directly controlling. This means the court made a mistake in applying the law to the case.
  <br>
  For example, Civil Rule 90.3 states the child support calculations for different parenting arrangements. If there is one child primarily living with one parent, Rule 90.3 states the other parent is supposed to pay 20% of their adjusted annual income to the other parent for the child support. If the judge figures out the child support amount to be 27% of adjusted income for one child, the motion for reconsideration would state that the judge misapplied Civil Rule 90.3.</li>
  <li> The court has overlooked or misconceived some material fact or proposition of law. This means the court got an important fact wrong.
  <br>
  For example, in a divorce case, the parties agree that the marital home is worth $100,000. The judge states that the house is worth $200,000.  The spouse who was awarded the house could file a motion for reconsideration.  The motion for reconsideration would state the judge used the wrong dollar amount for the house in dividing the property.</li>
  <li> The court has overlooked or misconceived a material question in the case. This means the court misunderstood what you were asking for in your case or in a motion.
  <br>
  For example, a child changed from living full time with their mom to living full time with their dad.  Under the child support formula, dad used to pay child support to mom based on the primary custody child support formula.  Now, mom should pay child support to dad based on the primary custody child support formula.  Dad filed a motion to modify child support.  The judge denied dad’s motion because the parents’ incomes did not change.  Dad can file a motion to reconsider and tell the judge they overlooked the question about whether there was a change in the parenting schedule.</li>
  <li> The law applied in the ruling was changed by a later court decision or statute. This means the court applied a rule or law that changed.
  <br>
  For example, on April 15, 2018, Civil Rule 90.3 changed to allow a parent to deduct the cost of their own health insurance from their gross income, up to 10% of the parent's gross income. If the court calculated child support on April 14, but did not allow for the health insurance deduction which resulted in a higher child support amount, the parent could file a motion for reconsideration based on the changed Civil Rule 90.3.</li>

template: learn_modify_step
subject: |
  Step ${ learn_modify_idx }: Learn about Motions to Modify
content: |
  Changing your child support order is called “modifying” child support.  The child support rule, [Alaska Rule of Civil Procedure 90.3](https://courts.alaska.gov/rules/docs/civ.pdf), states you need to prove there has been a “material change in circumstances” to modify child support. The most common changes in circumstances are:
  
    * Your children's schedule changes and they spend more or fewer overnights with you than they used to, or
    * Your income or the other parent's income changes.
    
  <div class='step-subheading'>Calculate your new child support amount</div>
  Figure out the new child support amount using the new schedule or new income information.  
    
    * Calculate the percent of overnights your children spend with you and with the other parent. For example, if your child spends 4 nights each week with you and 3 nights each week with their other parent, they spend 209 overnights each year with you and 156 nights each year with the other parent.  This is 57% of overnights with you and 43% of overnights with the other parent.  
    * Use the percentages to fill out the <strong>Child Support Guidelines Affidavit</strong>, [<a href="https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-305.pdf">DR-305</a>]. Read [How to Fill out the Child Support Guidelines Affidavit](https://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-dr305f-sample.pdf) to help you fill out this form.
    * If your children have a primary custody child support schedule, the <strong>Child Support Guidelines Affidavit</strong> tells you the new child support amount. If you do not have a primary custody child support schedule, use one of these forms:
    <ul>
  <li><strong>Shared Custody Support Calculation, [DR-306]</strong> [<a href="https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-306.pdf">Fill-In PDF</a>] for a shared custody schedule, </li>
  <li><strong>Hybrid Custody Child Support Calculation, [DR-308]</strong> [<a href="https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-308.pdf">PDF</a>] for a hybrid custody child support schedule, or</li>
  <li><strong>Divided Custody Child Support Calculation, [DR-307]</strong> [<a href="https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/dr-307.pdf">PDF</a>] for a divided custody child support schedule.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class='step-subheading'>Compare the old and new child support amounts to see if there is a material change in circumstances.</div>
    * If the new child support amount is 15% more or less than the old amount, there is a presumption that there is a material change in circumstances.
    * For example, if the old child support amount was $100 per month, there would be a material change if the new amount was
    * $85 or less, or
    * $115 or more.
  <div class='step-subheading'>Timing</div>
  
    * If your parenting schedule changes, or your income or the other parent’s income changes, it is important to tell the court **right away**.
    * The judge cannot go back and change child support that was due in the past.  They can only change child support starting when you file something asking to change it, and notify the other parent that you are asking for a change.
    * Until you file a motion in court, the old child support amount applies and the parent who owes child support still owes the old amount, even if income or the schedule has changed.
    * After you file your motion, but before the judge decides, can be confusing.  If the judge changes child support, they also pick the day the new amount starts.  This is usually the day a parent filed a Motion to Modify and gave it to the other parent.
  If child support changes, 1 parent may owe the other money for the time between when the motion was filed and when the judge decided.

content: |
  <p>You may want to file a <strong>Motion to Set Aside Judgment or Order</strong>. This motion asks the court to set aside or &quot;undo&quot; a final decision in a case.  You can ask the court to set aside your child support order if:
  <ul>
  <li>it is a <strong>&quot;reasonable&quot; amount of time</strong> since the date on the clerk’s certificate of distribution on the written order, and for some reasons <strong>no later than 1 year </strong>from that date, and</li>
  <li>it is based on one or more of the reasons stated in Civil Rule 60(a) or (b). </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  Use the date the court sent your child support order to you. Look at the last page of the order. The date is in the box at the bottom of the page. 
  [FILE CertOfDistrAnnotated.png, None, This is a screenshot of the box that shows the date the court sent your order to you.]    
  
  <p><strong>Civil Rule 60(a)</strong> provides that a party can file a <strong>Motion to Set Aside the Judgment or Order</strong> if the court made a clerical mistake or accidentally left something out of a document.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Civil Rule 60(b)</strong> specifies the reasons the court may set aside a judgment which include:
  <ul>
  <li>mistake; not paying close attention (inadvertence); an unexpected action, sudden confusion or an unanticipated event (surprise), or a legitimate excuse for failing to take required action (excusable neglect);<br>
  Note: it must be 1 year or less since the court distributed the judgment or order.</li>
  <li>newly discovered evidence which could not have been discovered by taking reasonable steps within the 10 days allowed to request a new trial;<br>
  Note: it must be 1 year or less since the court distributed the judgment or order.</li>
  <li>fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct from the other side;<br>
  Note: It must be 1 year or less since the court distributed the judgment or order.</li>
  <li>the judgment is void;<br>
  Note: It must be a &quot;reasonable&quot; amount of time since the court distributed the judgment or order.</li>
  <li>the judgment has been satisfied, released or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated or it is no longer fair that the judgment should apply at this time; <br>
  Note: It must be a &quot;reasonable&quot; amount of time since the court distributed the judgment or order.or</li>
  <li>any other reason justifying relief from the judgment <br>
  Note: It must be a &quot;reasonable&quot; amount of time since the court distributed the judgment or order.</li>
  </ul></p>
  <p>Examples of reasons under Civil Rule 60(b):
  <ul>
  <li>Paperwork filed contained mistakes or was filed incorrectly.</li>
  <li>The court did not have jurisdiction or authority over the matter.</li>
  <li>The judgment has already been paid.</li>
  <li>The party is a victim of identity theft.</li>

    * Hopefully they will follow the order and you will not need to go back to court.
    * If the other parent still does not cooperate, let the court know by filing a motion. A motion is a form you file with the court asking the judge to order the other side to do something.
    * If you file a motion, attach a copy of what you wrote to the other parent and anything they responded.
