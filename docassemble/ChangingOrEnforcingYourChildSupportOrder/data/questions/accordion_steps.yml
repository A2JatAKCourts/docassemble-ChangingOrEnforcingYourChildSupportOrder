  Step ${ ask_cssd_idx }: Ask CSED to change your child support
content: |
  <p>A child support order from Alaska Child Support Enforcement Division (CSED) is called an administrative order.  CSED can change administrative orders.  This is called "modifying" child support.</p>
  <p>CSED can modify your order if: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The cost of your child's health insurance premium changes, or </li>
    <li>Your income or the other parent's income changes so that a new child support calculation would be at least 15% more or 15% less than the payment you have now, or </li>
    <li>Your children's schedule changes so that a new child support calculation would be at least 15% more or 15% less than the payment you have now. </li>

  Step ${ learn_modify_child_support_idx }: Learn about motions to modify
content: |
  Changing your child support order is called “modifying” child support. To ask the judge to change your child support order, file a **Motion to Modify Child Support**. 
  
  The child support rule, [Alaska Rule of Civil Procedure 90.3](https://courts.alaska.gov/rules/docs/civ.pdf), states you need to prove there has been a “material change in circumstances” to modify child support. The most common changes in circumstances are:
  
    * Your children's schedule changes and they spend more or fewer overnights with you than they used to, or
    * Your income or the other parent's income changes.

  % if not middle_of_case:
  The court charges $75 to file this motion. If you cannot afford the fee, you may be able to get the court to waive it. See Step ${ file_motion_idx }, Pay the $75 fee, and file your Motion to Modify.

content: |
  <div class='step-subheading'>Compare your current child support to the new amount to see if there is a "material change in circumstances"</div>
    If the new child support amount is 15% more or less than the old amount, there is a presumption that there is a material change in circumstances.
    
   <strong>For example</strong>
   
   If the old child support amount was $100 per month, there would be a material change if the new amount is:
    * $85 or less, or
    * $115 or more.

template: dont_wait_modify_child_support_step
subject: |
  Step ${ dont_wait_modify_child_support_idx }: Do not wait to file your Motion to Modify 
content: |
  File your <strong>Motion to Modify Child Support</strong> and give the other parent a copy of your motion as soon as you can after there is a “material change of circumstances.”

  Until you file your motion with the court, <strong>the parent who owes child support still owes the amount in your current order</strong>. 
  
  If the judge agrees to change the amount of your child support, the judge will sign a new child support order.  The new order includes the date the amount changed. This date is usually in the past. It will not be earlier than the date you filed your motion and gave a copy to the other parent.

  <strong>For example</strong>

    * The other parent gets a new job making a lot more money on March 1.
    * You recalculate child support.  The other parent will owe you more child support each month.
    * You file a motion to modify child support with the court and give the other parent a copy June 21.
    * The judge agrees to change your child support and grants your motion.
    * The judge signs a new child support order on September 1.
    * The court cannot order child support to be changed before you filed your motion and gave a copy to the other parent.
    * The new order says that the new child support amount starts July 1.
    * Because you did not file your motion until June, the other parent only has to pay the old amount of child support from March 1 to July 1.

content: |
  When the other parent is not following your child support order, you can ask the court to order them to follow it. It is a good idea to talk to the other parent first:
  
    * Ask the other parent in writing to do what the order says.
    * In your written request, give them a date to do it by.
    * Keep your writing polite and professional.  Remember the judge may see it.
    * Tell them if they do not do it you will ask the judge to enforce the order.
    * Keep a copy of your written request and any written response you get back.
    * Hopefully they will follow the order and you will not need to go back to court.
    * If the other parent still does not cooperate, let the court know by filing a motion. A motion is a form you file with the court asking the judge to order the other side to do something.
    * If you file a motion, attach a copy of what you wrote to the other parent and anything they responded.

      * 1st class US mail, which is free.
      * Certified mail, which you have to pay for. Or
      * A process server, which you have to arrange and pay for.

      * Before coming to court, it is your responsibility to go to the Post Office and get the forms for certified mail, restricted delivery, return receipt requested, and figure out how much it will cost to mail the forms by this method and put the stamps on the envelope. If you don't provide the correct stamped envelope, your paperwork may be rejected.
      
    * **Process server**: Give the clerk:
    
      * the packet of forms to register a foreign order
      * service instructions for the specific process server you want the court to use. Read the instructions about Personal Service By Process Server in [CIV-106](https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/forms/docs/civ-106.pdf)
